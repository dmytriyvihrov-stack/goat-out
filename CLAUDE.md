# Working on Goat Out

Instructions for any session picking this project up. Read this first, then `CONCEPT.md` for what the
game is trying to be. `README.md` is for a player, this file is for whoever is building it.

---

## What this is

A playable prototype of a top-down, one-life, procedurally generated escape game. You are a sacrificial
goat running out of a cult's compound. Vanilla JavaScript, Canvas 2D, WebAudio. No build step, no
dependencies, no framework. Opening `index.html` runs the game.

The published build lives at **https://claude.ai/code/artifact/098e742b-e742-4ce7-8499-a303fa5db021**.
Always update that same URL rather than publishing a new artifact (see *Publishing* below).

## Ground rules

1. **Never add a new input.** The whole design rests on a small verb set: move, headbutt, grab/throw,
   roll, scream. Upgrades bend the numbers behind those verbs or change what a button does. They never
   add a seventh button. If a feature seems to need a new key, find a way to fold it into an existing one.
2. **All numbers live in `js/tuning.js`.** Nothing gameplay-relevant should be a literal anywhere else.
   If you find yourself typing `0.35` into `enemies.js`, it belongs in `TUNING`.
3. **Kills come from geometry.** A headbutt on its own only knocks a man down. Walls, pillars, fire,
   the mill and other bodies are what kill. Preserve that: it is the reason the game reads as Ape Out
   rather than a brawler.
4. **Both sides are clunky.** Every attack has a windup you can read and a recovery you must eat. Do not
   add cancels, combos, or i-frames beyond the roll's.
5. **Comment the why, not the what.** The code is dense; a one-line comment above a non-obvious block
   that explains the intent is worth more than a paragraph.

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `js/tuning.js` | `TILE`, `TILT`, `PALETTE`, `TUNING`, `BOON_BASE`, `BOONS`, `BARKS`, `LEVELS`. Every tunable number, every line the cult shouts, and the three level definitions. |
| `js/rng.js` | Seeded RNG (mulberry32) plus `clamp` / `lerp` / `len` / `angleDiff`. |
| `js/rooms.js` | Hand-authored room templates as character grids, with a legend at the top (`'w'` is a stand of arms). Also the start room, the arena, the Mill room, the Great Hall and the Gallery. |
| `js/gen.js` | Level generation: chains rooms, carves corridors, places props, spawns, heals, validates reachability. Defines the tile enum `T`. |
| `js/audio.js` | WebAudio. Buses, the drum machine, the music bed (`MUSIC`) and every one-shot effect. |
| `js/world.js` | Tile grid, collision, line of sight, flow field, fire (ordinary and witchfire), noise events, the persistent decal canvas, cult pictograms, the ritual start room. |

## Architecture notes

**Coordinates.** Simulation is flat top-down world space. Rendering squashes Y by `TILT` (0.86) so the
camera reads as slightly tilted. Sprites counter-squash with `ctx.scale(1, 1 / TILT)` so they stand
upright on a tilted floor. Anything drawn in world space that should not look squashed — floating text,
the `?` marks, the tome label — needs that same counter-scale with its `y` multiplied by `TILT`.
The mouse-to-world conversion in `readMoveInput` divides by `zoom * TILT` on the Y axis. If you add a
new screen-to-world conversion, do the same.

**The decal canvas.** `world.decal` is a persistent offscreen canvas at `DECAL_SCALE` (0.34) holding
blood, bodies, scorch marks, the cult pictograms and the start-room scene. It is never cleared during a
level. Pixel pictograms snap to whole decal pixels in `pixelGlyph`, otherwise the upscale turns them to
mush. Raising `DECAL_SCALE` costs memory fast: the world is 420x78 tiles.

**Two hits.** Anything with `hp > 1` — an arena elite, or any Seer — absorbs a killing blow in `die()`:
it goes down floored, loses one, gets up, and a Seer blinks clear. Fire counts, so a mage has to be lit
twice. Only `devour` and `boom` skip it.

**Dazed.** `enemy.daze(game, seconds)` is the scream's whole effect: the man freezes, whatever he was
winding up is cancelled, and stars orbit his head. It is a timer, not a state, so the flung / floored /
burning machinery underneath is untouched.

**Enemies.** One `Enemy` class. `kind` is `bearer`, `hunter`, `seer` or `butcher`; `update()` dispatches
to `updateBearer` / `updateHunter` / `updateSeer` / `updateButcher`. Shared machinery (perception, being
flung, burning, being held, the bomb fuse) sits above the dispatch. Arena bosses carry `elite` and `boss`
flags: elites absorb hits before dying, bosses drop a tome.

**Props.** One `Prop` class for brazier, pot, bell, door, table, lamp, mill, heal and weapon. `blocking`,
`stopsBullets` and `item` are getters, not fields. `headbutt()` dispatches per kind. `item` is what the
goat can pick up and throw — a pot or a weapon — and it is the test everywhere the code used to ask
`kind !== 'pot'`.

**Stands of arms.** A `weapon` prop is both the rack and the thing in it: `inStand` is true until it is
first taken, and the rack is only drawn while it is. `weapon` is `sword` or `shield`. It is grabbed like
a pot, thrown by releasing grab, and flies in `updateWeapon`; `hitMan` is where a sword kills and sticks
and a shield flattens and carries on, `passed` stopping it hitting the same man twice on one throw. A
carried shield turns `prop.weapon.shieldHits` bullets in `Bullet.update` before it splinters. Nothing is
consumed: both lie where they land and are grabbable again. `'w'` in a room template places one; `racks`
on a level definition is the chance an ordinary room gets one or two more.

**One new thing to a room.** `game.taught` is a list of what the run has already been shown — enemy
kinds, `'mill'`, `'<kind> boss'`. It is passed into `generateLevel` and comes back on the level as
`taught`. Any kind not in it gets a room to itself the first time it appears (the room's other men are
dropped); a new boss gets his arena alone, and the first Mill room keeps one man. `metRoom` inside the
generator also keeps the lone rifle posts from landing earlier in the level than the room that
introduces a rifle. A run that keeps its tomes keeps what it has learned; a fresh run forgets.

**Boons.** `game.mods` is recomputed from `game.boons` by `applyBoons()`. Every use site reads
`game.mods.X` rather than `TUNING` directly, so nothing mutates `TUNING` (which would leak across runs).
Adding a boon means: add it to `BOONS`, add its default to `BOON_BASE`, and read the mod at the use site.

**Fire has two kinds.** `world.fire` holds seconds left, `world.fireKind` holds 0 for ordinary flame and
1 for the Seer's witchfire. Witchfire spreads as witchfire, draws violet, scorches violet and ignores
`mods.fireImmune`; `isWitchPx` is the test. Anything that lights a tile passes the kind through.

**Barks.** `game.bark(enemy, kind, chance)` is the only way to make a man speak. It enforces a global gap
and a per-man cooldown, so a crowd never shouts at once. Lines live in `BARKS` in `tuning.js`; the bubble
is drawn in `drawEnemy`.

**Juice.** `game.kick(dx, dy, amt)` shoves the whole picture (capped at `juice.kickMax`), `zoomPunch`
drives the lens, `flash(color, amt)` paints an additive overlay, and `gore` throws chunks that stain the
decal canvas when they expire. The renderer applies kick and zoom in `draw`, and everything decays in
`updateEffects`.

**The pen.** Cage bars are ordinary `Prop`s of kind `cage`, built by `buildCage` in `gen.js` and exempt
from the three-tile prop clearance around the start. It takes `prop.cage.hits` blows — seven — and one
headbutt can reach two or three bars at once, so `breakCage` counts blows and not bars by gating on
`game.cageLunge === goat.lungeId`. Each blow bleats a line from `prop.cage.strain`; on the blows in
`prop.cage.stunAt` the goat is put on the floor by `game.stunGoat`. The last blow breaks every bar and
sets `game.cageOpen`, which is what hides the floor prompt. Only levels with `startCage` get one.

**Goat stun.** `goat.state === 'stunned'` is a real state, not a render pose: `Goat.update` returns early
while it lasts, so there are no verbs, no aim and no momentum, and `goat.dazed` draws the stars over it.
`game.stunGoat(seconds)` is the only way in, and the pen is the only thing that uses it.

**The opening scene.** `game.beginIntro()` runs in the real level 1 with the real pen, in state `intro`,
driven by `updateIntro` and one method per beat (`introHuddle`, `introApproach`, `introGate`,
`introGrab`, `introClub`, `introFade`, `introBlack`, `introWake`). Everything it owns lives in
`game.intro`: the sheep, the heart, the two men, the gate bars. The men are ordinary `Enemy` objects
with `scripted` set (their `update` returns at once, so anything that ages on them, such as a bark, is
aged by `updateIntro`) and `knife` on the one who carries the knife; they are moved with `followPath`
and speak with `say`, which bypasses the crowd rules of `bark`. The gate is the three `v`-axis bars on
the right of the pen; `prop.gate` (0..1) lays a bar flat in `drawPropBody`. The goat is moved by hand
too; `goat.state = 'ko'` is a render pose only, `goat.dazed` draws the stars, `goat.jitter` the tremble.
`skipIntro()` jumps to the dark, `skipIntro(true)` straight to play, and `endIntro` resets the goat and
removes the men. Only `startLevel(..., withIntro)` from the title or the win screen plays it; the
`ritual` flag on a level definition is what makes the first room the ritual room at all.

**Stairs.** `T.EXIT` and `T.ENTRY` are both drawn by `drawStairs`; `level.exitTile` and `level.entry`
say where each flight starts. Stepping onto the exit enters state `climb` (`beginClimb`, `updateClimb`)
for `stairs.climb` seconds before `levelCleared`. `game.stairFx = { t, dir }` is what `drawGoat` reads
to lift, shrink and fade him: `dir` 1 going up and out, -1 arriving, which `startLevel` sets on any level
with an `entry`. Levels without `ritual` start at the top of the entry flight rather than the room centre.

**The other cage.** Built by `buildCage(..., deco)` from `TUNING.prop.deadCage`; its bars carry `deco`,
which keeps them out of `breakCage`, out of the gate, and out of the in-front-of-the-goat draw pass.
What is in it is painted on the decal canvas by `paintStartRoom`.

**The loop.** Fixed 1/60 step, max 5 substeps, in `game.frame`. `timeScale` drives slow motion.
A `setInterval` fallback drives the loop when `requestAnimationFrame` stalls, which it does when the
Browser pane is hidden. Do not remove it.

---

## Testing

The desktop app's Browser pane has two traps. A **hidden pane reports a zero-size viewport**, so
responsive layout collapses to its fallback, and **`requestAnimationFrame` stalls**. Work around both:

1. Call `resize_window` with an explicit width and height before testing layout. Reset it to the
   `desktop` preset when finished.
2. Save frames through the dev server rather than the screenshot tool, which times out when the app
   window is behind another window.

Start the server, then load the harness in the page:

```bash
node tools/serve.js 8766
```

```js
const s = document.createElement('script'); s.src = '/tools/harness.js'; document.body.appendChild(s);
```

`H` then gives you `startPlay()`, `tp(x, y)`, `aimAt`, `walkTo`, `headbutt()`, `freeze(except)`,
`unfreeze()`, `nearest(kind)`, `waitFor(fn, ms)`, `status()` and `shot(name)` which writes to
`tools/shots/`. `startPlay()` clicks through the title and drops the opening scene with
`game.skipIntro(true)`; to watch the scene itself, set `game.input.lmbPressed = true` on the title and
wait for `game.state === 'intro'`. `game.startLevel(0, seed, false, true)` replays it from anywhere.

**Traps that have bitten before, in this exact order:**

- Teleporting the goat next to a wall and then testing a mechanic that needs line of sight. `los()`
  from inside a wall fails immediately and everything downstream looks broken.
- `H.freeze()` freezing the very enemy under test. Use `H.freeze(target)` to spare one.
- Reading the console and seeing errors from *before* the last reload. The buffer is not cleared by
  navigation. Install a fresh counter and wait, rather than trusting the tail of the buffer.

A fourth trap: `H.startPlay()` leaves the goat in the pen on level 1. Break out first
(`H.aimAt = {x, y}` at a bar, then `H.headbutt()`) or nothing downstream can move. And the dev spawner
drops men **aware and adjacent**, so a handful of them will kill the goat during a test unless
`game.dev.god` is on — a dead goat freezes every enemy, which reads as the feature under test being broken.

**Always run the generator sweep after touching `gen.js`, `rooms.js` or `LEVELS`.** It catches broken
templates and impossible layouts in seconds:

```bash
node -e 'const fs=require("fs"),vm=require("vm");const ctx={console,Math,Uint8Array,Int16Array,Int32Array,Float32Array};vm.createContext(ctx);for(const f of ["js/tuning.js","js/rng.js","js/rooms.js","js/gen.js"])vm.runInContext(fs.readFileSync(f,"utf8"),ctx,{filename:f});vm.runInContext(`let fails=0;for(let li=0;li<LEVELS.length;li++)for(let s=1;s<=250;s++){try{generateLevel(LEVELS[li],s*1337)}catch(e){fails++}}console.log("fails:",fails)`,ctx);'
```

A syntax check over every file costs nothing and catches the class of error that only shows up at
runtime, such as a canvas call with too few arguments:

```bash
for f in js/*.js tools/*.js; do node --check "$f" || echo "FAIL $f"; done
```

## Publishing

The artifact is published from `artifact.html` with all eleven scripts passed as supporting files, and
always to the existing URL. Republishing without the `url` creates a second artifact.

- `file_path`: `artifact.html`
- `url`: `https://claude.ai/code/artifact/098e742b-e742-4ce7-8499-a303fa5db021`
- `root`: the project directory
- `files`: every file in `js/`, mapped path-to-path
- `label`: a short version tag, for example `0.7 whatever landed`

If you add a new file under `js/`, it must go into three places: both HTML files' script lists and the
publish `files` map. Forgetting the map means the live page breaks while the local one works.

## Conventions

- Two-space indent, semicolons, single quotes. Dense one-liners are fine where they read cleanly.
- All prose in the game and in the code is English. The user writes in Russian and English; reply in
  whichever they used.
- Palette colours come from `PALETTE`, never as literals, except for one-off shading tints inside a
  single sprite.
- Fonts are `FONT` and `FONT_SC` constants in `render.js` (Alegreya and Alegreya SC from Google Fonts).
- Version history and the reasoning behind each change live in `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Open questions the user has not settled

- Mirrors as an environmental puzzle. The original voice note said "lizards and mirrors"; the mirror
  half was interpreted as a puzzle object and parked. The other half is still unresolved.
- Whether one life means one life per level (current behaviour) or one per whole run.
- Where his wife is. The opening scene carries her off deeper into the compound and nothing after it
  refers to her: no room, no ending, no line from the cult.
- Pixel art proper. Everything is still drawn with canvas primitives in the final palette.
- Gamepad support, a Priest boss, and the later acts sketched in `GOAT_OUT_brief.md`.

`GOAT_OUT_brief.md` is the original stage-one design brief. It is history, not spec: several of its
decisions have since been overridden. `CONCEPT.md` is the current truth.
